#Task 1: Code Correction You have been given a piece of code with several variable
#  and constant names that don't follow the Python naming convention. Your task is
#  to correct them:

PI = 3.14                       #Pi_value is now PI as this is a constant number
user_age = 25                   #userAge is now user_age as this is a variable
user_location = "New York"      #user_location remains the same as it is a variable
MAX_LIMIT = 1000                #MAXLIMIT is now MAX_LIMIT as it is the correct format of
                                #constants
