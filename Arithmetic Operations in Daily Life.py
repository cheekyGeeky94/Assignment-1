#Task 1: Grocery Store Math Calculate the total cost of three items you'd commonly find
#  in a grocery store, given their individual prices. For example, what would be the
#  cost of bread, peanut butter, and jelly be? Prices don't need to be realistic!

bread = 1.09
turkey_deli = 4.69
kraft_cheese = 4.79
total_cost = bread + turkey_deli + kraft_cheese
print("The price of bread is", bread)
print("The price of turkey meat is", turkey_deli)
print("The price of slice cheese is", kraft_cheese)
print("The total cost is", total_cost)

#Task 2: Bank Interest If you have a savings account with a particular initial amount
#  and a fixed yearly interest rate, calculate the total amount in your account after 
# a year. So if you had $10,000 at a 7% interest write code that would tell us the 
# amount at the end of the year. For the example the expected outcome would be $10,700.

savings_account = 10000
fixed_interest = savings_account * .07
total_amount = savings_account + fixed_interest
print("The amount with interest at the end of the year will be", total_amount)
